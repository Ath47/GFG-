Given a directed graph, determine whether a vertex j is reachable from another vertex i for all vertex pairs (i, j) in the given graph. Here, vertex j is reachable 
from another vertex i means that there is a path from vertex i to j. The reachability matrix is called the transitive closure of a graph. 
The directed graph is represented by an adjacency matrix where there are N vertices. 

Input: N = 4
graph = {{1, 1, 0, 1}, 
         {0, 1, 1, 0}, 
         {0, 0, 1, 1}, 
         {0, 0, 0, 1}}
Output: {{1, 1, 1, 1}, 
         {0, 1, 1, 1}, 
         {0, 0, 1, 1}, 
         {0, 0, 0, 1}}
Explanation: 
The output list shows the reachable indexes

class Solution{
public:
    vector<vector<int>> transitiveClosure(int n, vector<vector<int>> graph)
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                for(int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                    if(graph[j][i] && graph[i][k]) {
                        graph[j][k] = 1;
                    }
                }
                graph[i][] = 1;
            }
        }
        return graph;
    }
};

Expected Time Complexity: O(N3)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N2)
