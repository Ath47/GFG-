Given a matrix(2D array) M of size N*N consisting of 0s and 1s only. The task is to find the column with maximum number of 0s. If more than one column exists, print the one which comes first. If the maximum number of 0s is 0 then return -1.

Example:

Input:
N = 3
M[][] = {{0, 0, 0},
          {1, 0, 1},
          {0, 1, 1}}
Output:
0
Explanation:
0th column (0-based indexing) is having 2 zeros which is maximum among all columns and comes first.


class Solution{
    public:
    /*Function to count zeros in each column
    * N : Number of rows and columns in array
    M is the matrix that is globally declared
    */
    int columnWithMaxZeros(vector<vector<int>>arr,int N){
        
        int cnt = 0, idx = -1;
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            int numZero = 0;
            for(int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                if(arr[j][i] == 0) {
                    numZero++;
                }
            }
            if(numZero > cnt) {
                cnt = numZero;
                idx = i;
            } 
        }
        return idx;
        
    }
};

Expected Time Complexity: O(N * N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 103
0 <= A[i][j] <= 1
