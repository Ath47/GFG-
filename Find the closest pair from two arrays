Given 2 sorted arrays arr, brr and number x, find the pair whose sum is closest to x and pair has element from each array. In case of multiple closest pairs return any one of them.


class Solution{
  public:
    vector<int> printClosest(int arr[], int brr[], int n, int m, int x) {
        int l = 0, r = m - 1;
        int diff = INT_MAX;
        vector<int> ans;
        while(l < n && r >= 0) {
            int sum = arr[l] + brr[r];
            if(diff > abs(sum - x)) {
                diff = abs(sum - x);
                ans = {arr[l], brr[r]};
            }else if(sum < x) {
                l++;
            }else r--;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
