Given a number N and a bit number K, check if Kth index bit of N is set or not. A bit is called set if it is 1. Position of set bit '1' should be indexed starting with 0 from LSB side in binary representation of the number.
Note: Index is starting from 0. You just need to return true or false, driver code will take care of printing "Yes" and "No".

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 4
K = 0
Output: 
No
Explanation: 
Binary representation of 4 is 100, in which 0th index bit from LSB is not set. So, return false.

class Solution
{
    public:
    // Function to check if Kth bit is set or not.
    bool checkKthBit(int n, int k)
    {
        // Your code here
        // It can be a one liner logic!! Think of it!!
        return (1 << k & n);
    }
};


Expected Time Complexity: O(1).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 109
0 ≤ K ≤ 31
