Given two strings a and b. The task is to find if the string 'b' can be obtained by rotating (in any direction) string 'a' by exactly 2 places.

Example 1:

Input:
a = amazon
b = azonam
Output: 
1
Explanation: 
amazon can be rotated anti-clockwise by two places, which will make it as azonam.

class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to check if a string can be obtained by rotating
    //another string by exactly 2 places.
    bool isRotated(string str1, string str2)
    {
        if(str1.size() != str2.size()) return false;
        int n = str1.size();
        
        if(n <= 2 && str1 == str2) return true;
        
        string x = str1.substr(2) + str1.substr(0, 2);
        string y = str1.substr(n - 2, 2) + str1.substr(0, n - 2);
        
        if(x == str2 || y == str2) return true;
        else return false;
    }

};

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxilary Complexity: O(N).
Challenge: Try doing it in O(1) space complexity.

Constraints:
1 ≤ length of a, b ≤ 105
